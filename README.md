nutrition-facts
============

This is a web component that gets nutrition facts in json format and outputs a nicely formatted Nutrition Facts with live text.

See the [component page](http://rachelslurs.github.io/nutrition-facts) for more information and check out the [demo](http://rachelslurs.github.io/nutrition-facts/demo.html) to see it in action.

_This project was created during a GDG New York DevFest. It is still very much a work in progress_
